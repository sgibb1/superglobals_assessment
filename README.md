# Superglobals Assessment

In this programming assignment you will be practicing how to use the PHP $_GET Superglobal.

Your finished product should be a link to a GitHub repository with a PHP file inside.

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Write an index.php file with a standard HTML file inside of it

Pick your favorite movie and put the title, release year, gross revenue, and a poster picture URL as query params at the end of your URL

<ol> Use $_GET and echo out the following
  <li>The title inside of a heading tag</li>
  <li>The year released inside of a tag</li>
  <li>The gross revenue inside of a tag</li>
  <li>The URL inside of an img tag</li>
  </ol>

Be sure to protect your use of $_GET so that a nefarious instructor doesn't dock you points for being able to break your website.
